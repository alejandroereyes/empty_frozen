# EmptyFrozen

Need to return something other than `nil`? We've all needed to from time to time ðŸ˜… . Sometimes no mutation will be done to this returning value and sometimes there will; `empty_frozen`'s got you covered either way.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'empty_frozen'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install empty_frozen

## Usage

```ruby
require 'empty_frozen'

...

def space_instagram
  return Hash.empty if cadet?

  visited.celestial.each_with_object({}) do |celestial, hsh|
    hsh[celestial] = selfies_taken_at celestial
  end
end

def potential_pet_recommendations
  return Array.empty_frozen if has_no_heart?

  liked.animals.map(&:species).uniq
end

```
